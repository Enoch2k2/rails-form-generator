# Form Resource Creator

This simple form app is a test showing how you can use a form to create resource migrations via rails.

## Form

Start the rails server.
Name your resource you want to create.
Give 2 string attributes.
Give 2 integer attributes.
Click submit and watch your server as it creates the resource and migrates it into the database.

This was just a sample app to show how to use system commands to run rails commands in the backend of your app.
