# Form Resource Creator

This simple form app is a test showing how you can use a form to create resource migrations via rails.

## Form

Start the rails server\n
Name your resource you want to create\n
Give 2 string attributes\n
Give 2 integer attributes\n
Click submit and watch your server as it creates the resource and migrates it into the database.\n\n

This was just a sample app to show how to use system commands to run rails commands in the backend of your app.
